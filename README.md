Home Made HomeKit
=================

A repo that contains various example implementations for building HomeKit-like platforms and devices. Includes:

* IRIS: An iOS application for giving voice commands to control hardware devices with a network connection

* BULB: An Arduino based, network enabled IoT device that can listen for incoming commands on a Pusher channel and turn lights on and off

* DÃ–RR: An Arduino based, Bluetooth LE driven IoT device that can open any door that works with a buzzer (coming soon, in the meantime check out [Heimdal](https://github.com/Hipo/Heimdal-ios))
